## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.56 or higher
- Cargo package manager
- Network access for monitoring devices

## Installation (Linux/MacOS)

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/karthik558/Rust-Ping.git &&
cd Rust-Ping
```
2. Build the project:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
3. Run the application:
```sh
cargo run
```
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html` to access the dashboard.

## Installation (Windows)
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/karthik558/Rust-Ping.git &&
cd Rust-Ping
```
2. MinGW-w64 or MSYS2 should be installed. Follow the instructions on the [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/) to install it.

3. If you have not installed Rust, follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it.

4. If msys2 is not working, you can download the [MinGW-w64 installer](https://github.com/Vuniverse0/mingwInstaller/releases/download/1.2.1/mingwInstaller.exe) and install it.

5. Download and install it and make sure to add the path to the `bin` folder of MinGW-w64 to your system's PATH environment variable. The path should look something like this:
```
C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\x86_64-8.1.0-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0\mingw64\bin
```

6. Make sure ```
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu``` is set. You can check this by running:
```sh
rustup show
```
7. Open a new command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Rust-Ping
```
8. Build the project:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
9. Run the application:
```sh
cargo run
```
10. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the dashboard.


## Configuration
Create/edit the `devices.json` file in the root directory to add or modify devices to be monitored. The configuration file should be in JSON format and include the following fields:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Router",
    "ip": "192.168.1.1",
    "sensors": ["Ping", "Http"],
    "http_path": "http://192.168.1.1"
  },
  {
    "name": "NAS",
    "ip": "192.168.1.2",
    "sensors": ["Ping"]
  }
]
```

## Usage
1. Access the dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
2. Add devices to monitor by editing the `devices.json` file.
3. The dashboard will automatically refresh every 5 seconds to display the latest status of the devices.
4. Click on the device name to view detailed logs and sensor data.
5. Export logs to CSV/TXT format for further analysis.
